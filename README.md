# Machine-Learning-for-Iot-Devices
This repository contatins the programs that I wrote for Machine Learning for IoT Devices course.

## List of the projects

- HW 1: Pre Processing The Data - Deep Learning Classifier - Linear Regression
- HW 2: Building a Neural Network From Scratch for Image Classification

The rest of the labs did not require code development.
Each Directory has its own README.
